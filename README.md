# ink_roguelike
A narrative mini-roguelike written completely in ink, featuring simple level generation, hit detection, and permadeath (because if you try to go back in Inky, everything regenerates automatically!).

You are finishing your solo shift at Cost Company and need to complete a sweep of the store before heading home. Can you escape Dungeon Mall, clean up all the spills and save the lost children?

### How to play
To play, just paste the raw .ink file into [Inky](https://github.com/inkle/inky/releases) and play in the preview pane! 

Once the Inky's inkjs export is updated version 0.8.1, I hope to have a web playable version as well.
