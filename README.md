# ink_roguelike

![ink_roguelike gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nbush/ink_roguelike/master/ink_roguelike.gif)

A narrative mini-roguelike written completely in ink, featuring simple level generation, hit detection, and permadeath (because if you try to go back in Inky, everything regenerates automatically!).

You are finishing your solo shift at Cost Company and need to complete a sweep of the store before heading home. Can you escape Dungeon Mall, clean up all the spills and save the lost children? Or will you fall asleep among the aisles under the dominion of overtime?

### How to play
#### Inky
To play, just paste the raw .ink file into [Inky](https://github.com/inkle/inky/releases) and play in the preview pane! 

#### Web
You can now play it on the web at [itch.io](https://bushn.itch.io/dark-aisle)! Thanks to y-lohse for maintaining [inkjs](https://github.com/y-lohse/inkjs).
